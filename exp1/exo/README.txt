This project investigates the mechanisms of exogenous attention across space. Exogenous attention is the involuntary type of spatial covert attention that
automatically increases spatial resolution and, according to texture segmentation experiments, preferentially modulates high spatial frequencies (SF). In this experiment, 
we will measure the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and assess how exogenous attention modulates it at various eccentricities. 

There are various possibilities by which exogenous attention will affect the CSF:
1. Gain
If exogenous attention increases the gain on all SFs equally, the CSF will be shifted upward when attention is manipulated.

2. Tuning
Exogenous attention could narrow spatial filters, increasing sensitivity to high SFs but leading to costs at very high SFs where further narrowing would reduce sensitivity,
given that our sensitivity to high SFs is very low.

3. Gain + Tuning
Exogenous attention could increase sensitivity to low and medium SFs but reduce sensitivity at very high SFs.

4. Shift CSF to high SFs
Exogenous attention could lead to a multiplicative gain on SF, which would be realized as a rightward shift of the CSF, causing benefits at some SFs and costs at others.  

This project was borne out of texture segmentation results showing that exogenous attention automatically increases spatial resolution by increasing sensitivity to high SFs 
(Yeshurun & Carrasco, 1998, 2000, 2008; Talgar et al., 2002; Carrasco et al., 2006; Yeshurun et al., 2008; Jigo & Carrasco (2018)). Here, we will be exploring whether such 
SF-specific modulation is evident when individual SF channels are probed. Note: only first-order (luminance-defined) processing will be probed here.

Our contrast sensitivity measurements will be fit with a single CSF model for neutral and attention CSFs.

The outcomes of this project will be n-fold:
1) Characterize, for the first time, how attention affects a
fundamental visual dimension, contrast sensitivity, across space.
   * via tuning to high SFs? (high SF improved, low SF sensitivity impaired)
   * via gain on high SFs? (high SF improved, low SF unchanged)
   * via uniform gain across SFs? (high and low improved)
   * mix of all the above

2) Identify which CSF model (taken from Watson & Ahumada, 2000 and others yet
to be found) can best fit both neutral and attention CSFs.

3) Specify which parameters of the CSF change with attention (peak SF? peak
sensitivity? high or slow-SF cutoff slope?) via model comparisons in which
some parameters are fixed and others are left to vary.

What we can conclude:
1) We will get a functionally-mechanistic picture of how exogenous attention affects SF sensitivity across the visual field.

Future directions:
In Experiment 1, we will use fixed stimulus sizes to assess how exogenous attention affects the CSF in "normal" viewing conditions. That is, the Gabor stimuli will not be
scaled based on cortical magnification, SF, or orientation. This will allow us to measure how attention acts to compensate (maybe it doesn't compensate...) for
the inhomogeneities across the visual field.

In Experiment 2, all stimuli will be appropriately scaled to assess whether exogenous attention still affects the gain or tuning of spatial filters when visibility is 
matched at all eccentricities. If not, exogenous acts as a compensatory mechanism that tries to match the visibility to SFs at all eccentricities. NOTE: Use equations in
Carrasco, McLean, Katz, & Frieder, 1998 to scale stimuli appropriately.
